- Use "cd path/to/directory" command in your Command Prompt to navigate and switch your current directory to Task 1 folder
- After your directory in Command Prompt is pointed to Task 1 folder, type the below command and run:
	python "Task 1.py" "path/to/your_test_image_folder/your_chosen_test_image"
For example: python "Task 1.py" "C:\Users\ASUS STRIX\Documents\Machine Learning\assignment\Assignment2\Test\5. Pingpong\IMG_0627.PNG"
- Then wait and the result of classification will be displayed in a few second

#### Task 2:
- Change directory to folder "Task 2". (cd path/to/directory)
- Use command: 
	python "Task 2.py" "path/to/your_test_image_folder/your_chosen_test_image"
For example: python "Task 2.py" "C:\Users\ASUS STRIX\Documents\Machine Learning\assignment\Assignment2\Test\5. Pingpong\IMG_0627.PNG"
- After finish running, go to folder "Task 2" to find file "reverse_search_output.png" to see the result.
